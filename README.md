I only have found a moderate correlation between distance from equator and maximum temperature for Nothern hemisphere. Cloudiness, wind speed and humidity do not seem to correlate with distance from equator or latitude. 
However, there may be some data limitations, including: time of the year - winter in Northern hemisphere and summer in Southern hemisphere. Possibly, the data would be more similar in both hemispheres during spring/fall seasons. Another postential limitation is that my Northern hemisphere dataset contains 628 rows, while Souther hemisphere dataset only contains 262 rows.
